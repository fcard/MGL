[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fcard/MGL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fcard/MGL) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fcard/MGL/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/fcard/MGL)

A way to program Game Maker while avoiding depending on GUIs (but not necessarily giving them up), as well as having extra features inspired by more advanced programming languages.

# (Planned) Features

* Game Maker Studio 1 & 2 syntatic features can be used in earlier versions
* Functions instead of scripts, as well as object methods
* Syntax for a wrapper object pattern to simulate multiple inheritance
* Modules with a inter-depedency system, allowing for better organization and partial compilation of projects
* Constants defined with compile-time expressions, that can be associated with particular objects

# Possible Features

* Minor, optional compile-time type checking
* AST-aware macros and metaprogramming
* Alternative compile targets

# TODO

* Only partial parsing is implemented, oops
* Coming next: Creating resource trees from code
