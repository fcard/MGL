# MGL

A way to program Game Maker while avoiding depending on GUIs (but not necessarily giving them up), as well as having extra features inspired by more advanced programming languages.

# Features

* Game Maker Studio 1 & 2 syntatic features can be used in earlier versions
* Functions instead of scripts, as well as object methods
* Syntax for a wrapper object pattern to simulate multiple inheritance
* Modules with a inter-depedency system, allowing for better organization and partial compilation of projects
* Constants defined with compile-time expressions, that can be associated with particular objects

# Possible Features

* Minor, optional compile-time type checking
* AST-aware macros and metaprogramming

# TODO

* Only partial parsing is implemented, oops
* Coming next: CI Integration; Coverage
